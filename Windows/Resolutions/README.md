# How to setup?
Run the file called 'latest.cmd', then the main library will be located at **./bin/v10.0.0-winDisplaySettings-x64.node**

if you are a versions of the RPG Maker MV is to 1.5.2 or less, you can call below code so you change the build config.

```cmd
latest.cmd "0.12.3"
```

Or you can use prebuilt libraries!

[v10.0.0-winDisplaySettings-ia32.node](https://github.com/biud436/MV/raw/master/Windows/Resolutions/bin/v10.0.0-winDisplaySettings-ia32.node)

[v10.0.0-winDisplaySettings-x64.node](https://github.com/biud436/MV/raw/master/Windows/Resolutions/bin/v10.0.0-winDisplaySettings-x64.node)

if you have the library called *.node already, please place it under your **/js/libs directory** and then
insert the plugin called **"RS_ScreenManager.js"** in your Plugin Manager.

# Supports
